# hack-or-emergency-response
This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks for exploring and working with Portland crime and Fire & Rescue Dept data as part of 
[Hack Oregon's](http://www.hackoregon.org/) 2016 data projects with the City of Portland. The notebooks use the Python 3.6 kernel.

1) [Crime data EDA notebook](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/NIJ%20EDA.ipynb)

2) [Fire Disptach data EDA notebook](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/Fire%20Dispatch%20EDA.ipynb)

I have imported [data](https://www.nij.gov/funding/pages/fy16-crime-forecasting-challenge.aspx#data) from the NIJ into Postgres on a Linux VM using Vagrant. You can see my provision scripts [here](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/provision_script.sh) and [here](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/provision_script_vagrant.sh).

I have also added some [notes](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/database.md) on importing crime data into the EC2 db.
