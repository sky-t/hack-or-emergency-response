# hack-or-emergency-response
This repository contains [my Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/NIJ%20EDA.ipynb) for exploring and working with Portland crime data as part of 
[Hack Oregon's](http://www.hackoregon.org/) 2016 data projects with the City of Portland. 

I have imported [data](https://www.nij.gov/funding/pages/fy16-crime-forecasting-challenge.aspx#data) from the NIJ into Postgres on a Linux VM using Vagrant. You can see my provision scripts [here](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/provision_script.sh) and [here](https://github.com/sky-t/hack-or-emergency-response/blob/master/provision_script_vagrant.sh).
